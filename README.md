## Gameplay Guide

### Getting Started
1. Launch the game and create a new game or load an existing save
2. Use arrow keys to pilot your ship through space
3. Approach stations (blue circles) and dock with 'D' when close and moving slowly
4. Trade commodities for profit using the 'T' key when docked
5. Accept missions from the mission board ('M' key) for additional income
6. Upgrade your ship at shipyards and research stations ('U' key)

### Combat
- Enemy bandit ships will attack on sight
- Use SPACE to fire weapons
- Different weapon types have varying damage, range, and energy costs
- Avoid or destroy hazardous asteroids
- Stay away from black holes - they're extremely dangerous
- Purchase stealth systems to avoid detection
- Use repair systems to maintain your ship's hull

### Trading Strategy
- Buy low at production stations, sell high at consumption stations
- Mining stations often have cheap metals
- Research stations pay well for technology
- Monitor market prices and station inventories
- Mission commodities are tracked separately from regular cargo

### Ship Progression
- Earn credits through trading and missions
- Purchase upgrades in categories: Cargo, Engine, Hull, Scanner, Stealth
- Each category has 4 tiers of improvements
- Higher tier upgrades require previous tiers
- Specialized stations offer discounts on certain upgrade types
