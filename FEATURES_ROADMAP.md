- **Integration:** Affect hazard generation, enemy AI, mission rewards
- **Persistence:** Save with game state

#### Difficulty Levels
```python
class DifficultyLevel(Enum):
    PEACEFUL = "peaceful"      # No enemies, reduced hazards
    EASY = "easy"             # Fewer enemies, more forgiving
    NORMAL = "normal"         # Balanced gameplay
    HARD = "hard"             # More enemies, higher damage
    EXTREME = "extreme"       # Maximum challenge
```

#### Affected Systems
- **Hazard Frequency:** Asteroid density, black hole count
- **Enemy Spawning:** Bandit ship frequency and aggression
- **Damage Scaling:** Collision and weapon damage multipliers
- **Mission Rewards:** Credit payouts and time limits
- **Resource Costs:** Repair costs and upgrade prices

#### Settings Integration

### 4. Enhanced Debris Physics üåå
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Planned  

#### Description
Make debris fields more dynamic by having them affected by gravitational forces from planets and black holes.

#### Implementation Plan
- **Location:** Enhance `src/entities/debris.py`
- **Physics:** Add gravitational force calculations
- **Visual:** Debris trails and movement indicators

#### Technical Details
```python
class Debris:
    def __init__(self, position, velocity):
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = velocity
        self.mass = random.uniform(0.1, 2.0)
        self.affected_by_gravity = True
        self.drift_speed = random.uniform(10, 50)
    
    def update(self, delta_time, gravitational_bodies):
        if self.affected_by_gravity:
            for body in gravitational_bodies:
                force = body.calculate_gravitational_force(self)
                self.velocity += force * delta_time / self.mass
```

#### Gravitational Effects
- **Black Holes:** Strong attraction, debris spiral inward
- **Planets:** Weak attraction, debris orbits at distance
- **Debris Clouds:** Form around gravitational bodies
- **Collision Chains:** Debris can collide and affect each other

#### Visual Enhancements
- Debris trails showing movement direction
- Dust clouds around gravitational bodies
- Particle effects for debris interactions
